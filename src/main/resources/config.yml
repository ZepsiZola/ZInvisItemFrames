  # Sets the middle item of the invisible item frame crafting recipe.

  # If you want only certain players to have access to the recipe, these are the permissions:
  # zinvisitemframes.craft.item_frame
  # zinvisitemframes.craft.glow_item_frame

  # Invisible glowing item frames are glow_item_frame that emit light
  # Invis glow_item_frame will have the same recipe as normal invis item_frame but with glow_item_frame

  # Whether an invisible item frame will have a glowing outline if it is empty.
  # Good to help people differentiate which frames are invis frames.
